# Real-time Configuration Adaptation for Video Analytics
We explored the configuration adaptation with video analytics based on object moving features.
We proposed a machine learning-based classification method to dynamic predict the configuration for future frames.
We experimented on three applications: Pose estimation, Speaker detection and Traffic tracking with high performance.
